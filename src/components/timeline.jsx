                        <p>
                          I worked as an IT assistant at Huskertech which was the main Information Technology service provider for University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I assisted students and UNL faculty to diagnose and troubleshoot various software application, computer hardware, operating systems, and network connection
                          issues by utilizing my knowledge in the aspect of software and hardware. I helped them with technology questions while establishing proper communication and customer service skills by providing in-depth, step-by-step guidance over the phone call, support tickets online, and walk-in appointments.

                          I was very proud to be chosen as an International Welcome Team member after a tough selection process competing with approximately 180 talented candidates. This role required us to always be a role model for the incoming international students and made them feel at home. I had to
                          demonstrate flexibility working with my fellow peers to ensure to ensure 450 studentsâ€™ needs are met during international orientation and welcome week. It had been a crazy and amazing journey working for this job and the most rewarding part from this job was the valuable friendships
                          that all of us held dearly.
